## Features

- **Summaries**\
  View a summary of the storyline for each state of a scenario.

  To prevent spoilers we only include a summery up-to the current scenario. The conclusion of a scenario is added after
  it has been completed.
- **Clear and organized**\
  Use the neat Flowchart overview of your completed and unlocked scenarios to keep track of your progress. The scenarios
  are color coded to quickly find available ones.

  Furthermore, it keeps your story organized!
  Blocked scenarios are displayed, along with their requirements. This way, you won't need to read up the requirements
  in the book and risk seeing spoilers.

  When you complete scenarios, you will be granted Party and Global achievements. The app features an achievements
  overview, where all your accomplishments are displayed.

  Share your progress with your party members! Easy with Gloomhaven Storyline!

  purchasing a license. Only one person in your party needs to purchase a license, and your whole party can benefit!

  With it, you can track party-related info like reputation, donations, prosperity and more, all in one place!
