## Features
- **Summaries**\
  View a summary of the storyline for each state of a scenario.
  
  To prevent spoilers we only include a summery up-to the current scenario. The conclusion of a scenario is added after it has been completed.
- **Clear and organized**\
  Use the neat Flowchart overview of your completed and unlocked scenarios to keep track of your progress. The scenarios are color coded to quickly find available ones.
  
  Furthermore, it keeps your story organized!
  Blocked scenarios are displayed, along with their requirements. This way, you won't need to read up the requirements in the book and risk seeing spoilers.
  
  When you complete scenarios, you will be granted Party and Global achievements. The app features an achievements overview, where all your accomplishments are displayed.
- **Share with party**\
  Share your progress with your party members! Easy with Gloomhaven Storyline!
  
  You can share your progress manually, or have the app sync it automagically between you and your party members by purchasing a license. Only one person in your party needs to purchase a license, and your whole party can benefit!
- **Party Sheet**\
  Gloomhaven storyline tracker features a Party Sheet!
  
  With it, you can track party-related info like reputation, donations, prosperity and more, all in one place!
- **Map view**\
  See all of the scenarios you've played and achievements you've gained, displayed on the original Gloomhaven map!
  
  All Global achievements and scenarios displayed on the map are clickable and the full functionality of the Flowchart view is also available in this Map view.
- **Filters**\
  Gloomhaven Storyline includes the option to track looted chests and a filter feature to find completed scenarios with chests you missed.
